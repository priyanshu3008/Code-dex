    <h1> Bruschetta  </h1>
     <p> Ingredient</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Juicy, ripe tomatoes at room temperature, not fridge cold</li>
        <li>Good quality extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>A good, crusty bread that can hold up to the juicy topping.<br> Sourdough and ciabatta are my picks.<br> Skip the basic sandwich bread – it will literally disintegrate from the juices.<br> Thin baguettes work ok if you toast well (because they have a smaller surface area).<br> Great starter option!</li>
        <li>*CHAFFY TIP** Rub the hot toast with garlic.<br> This is a little trick that gives bruschetta an edge that makes it even better than just mixing garlic through the tomato mixture.<br> It’s the reason why the bruschetta at your favourite bistro is so good – now you can replicate it yourself at home!</li>
     </ul>

     <p>Recipe</p>
     <ol>
        <li> <b>Deseed tomato (optional)</b> – Halve the tomato then scoop out the watery seeds using a teaspoons.<br> Deseeding is optional, not mandatory! It removes the watery centre which dilutes the flavour.<br> To be honest, I never bother deseeding when I’m making this just for myself!</li>
        <li><b>chop</b> tomato into small pieces.</li>
        <li><b>Toss</b>with chopped basil, olive oil, salt and pepper – that’s all you need for<br> a classic Italian version. More on variations below!</li><br>
       <b> Set aside </b> for 5 to 10 minutes to get it real juicy and for the flavours to come together – it’ll be fine for up to 30 minutes but after that, it gets a bit too mushy for my liking.
        <li> <b>Toast bread</b>  – Meanwhile, brush each side of the bread with olive oil and toast in the oven until golden.<br> Or, for a quicker version, just use your toaster.</li>
        <li> <b> Rub with garlic</b> – Whichever method you use to toast your bread, don’t skip rubbing the bread lightly with the cut face of a garlic clove <br> for authentic bruschetta flavour!</li>
        <li><b>Pile</b>on the tomato basil topping and devour!</li>
     </ol>
