    <h1>PRO FOOTBALL; Dayne's Future Decided, But Fassel's Not Telling Yet</h1>
    <p>
        Ron Dayne's immediate future with the Giants has been decided. He just does not know what it is yet.<br>
        Giants Coach Jim Fassel said yesterday that he had made all the decisions concerning his final cut to a 53-man roster, but he would not tell the players until today. And the team does not intend to make the cuts public until 4 p.m. tomorrow, the N.F.L deadline.<br>
        This tortured process holds the fate of many players in suspended animation, but the drama surrounding Dayne, the Giants' No. 1 draft pick in 2000, is the thickest.<br>
        Fassel started Dayne in the final preseason game Thursday against Baltimore. That was a surprise move because Fassel had said Dorsey Levens would be the first back whose name is not Tiki Barber to get the ball<br>
